        <p>Welcome to the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Airoli. The Department of Mechanical engineering is established in1993. Department offers B.E. course in Mechanical Engineering. Department started M.E. Program in CAD/CAM and Robotics with the intake of 18 students in 2011. Again in subsequent year Department has started Ph.D. Programme with the intake of 10.</p>

        <p>Mechanical engineering is a discipline of engineering that applies the principles of engineering, for design, analysis, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems. A team of highly qualified and experienced staff is the major strength of the department.</p>
        
        <p>Department aims at preparing students with a sound engineering knowledge and a multi-disciplinary approach, imparting high quality and industry oriented curriculum. To accomplish this, Department organizes large number of co-curricular and extracurricular activities such as industrial visits, design & poster competitions, technical paper presentations, guest lectures on recent trends in mechanical engineering, soft skills etc. The Department is associated with 3 major professional student chapters viz. SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) , ISHRAE(Indian society of Heating, refrigerating and air conditioning Engineers) and ASHRAE (American society of Heating, refrigerating and air conditioning Engineers)which help students to build their technical as well as professional skills and add value in the process of acquiring knowledge. Studentâ€™s organization the Forum of Mechanical Engineering Students (FOMES) regularly conducts various technical events. Department promotes various research and development activities initiated by its staff and the students.</p>
