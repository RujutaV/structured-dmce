        A Warm welcome to the Department of Humanities Engineering at Datta Meghe College of Engineering, Airoli. The Department offers UG (BE) program. The BE Humanities Engineering program was started in the year 1999. The department has evolved steadily in terms of faculty expertise, infrastructure, and quality of education and student performance. The department is a vibrant place with 13 full time faculty members from reputed institutions and dedicated supporting staff.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">BE Humanities Engineering program is an excellent blend of fundamentals of Humanities Engineering and allied branches combined with practical skills which are essentials to begin professional practice after graduation. Our students are exposed to practical problems through the department’s 10 well equipped laboratories including Computational Laboratory using software like MATLAB and Hysis. Induction of students in academic projects and series of technical presentations help them become competent and confident Humanities Engineers.</p>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">Industrial tours and in-plant training are organized in reputed Humanities plants for our Students every semester to link classroom teaching with Humanities plant operation. Variety of workshops and guest lectures on advanced/emerging topics in Humanities Engineering are also organized for students. Reputed firms visit our campus to recruit the graduating engineers.</p>
        
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Students play a major role in the department activities too. A departmental student’s professional body, “STUDENTS ORGANISATION OF Humanities ENGINEERS” and IICHE Students Chapter is very active and under these bodies students organize various events, guest lectures of experts from reputed Institute and organizations every year. Students participate in various cultural, sports and technical competitions held at various institutes spread across the country. The department also encourages faculty and students’ participation in various seminars, conferences, competition and events organized at IITs and other reputed institutions and organizations.</p>
